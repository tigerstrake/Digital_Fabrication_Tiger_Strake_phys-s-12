  Today we didn't get new homework, but I wanted to use this website to reflect on the lesson!
  <br>
  <br>
  We started this lesson with studying robots built by former students. All of the five shown models were sophisticated and had different approaches of how they were built. The common basis was that in all of them were stepper motors assembled. I found Suvin’s Bio-printer most intriguing. It was completely built by himself This printer doesn’t have a regular extruder, but rather a syringe. To me, it was a clever and ingenious approach.
  <br>
  Furthermore, I was fascinated by stepper motors. The electric motor is very precise when dividing a full rotation into a number of equal steps. They are often used in robots and 3d printers etc. I have never programmed one of these motors before, but I definitely will do it in the next weeks at home.
