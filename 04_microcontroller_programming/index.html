#### Week 2: Microcontroller programming 
<font size="4">
In this lesson we learned how to use Arduinos. Arduinos are small microcontrollers, meaning that they can manage input and output devices. This way you can for example program the Arduino
to move an actuator when a button is pressed. This is a very simplified example, they can manage much more complicated in- and output. 
<br>
The assignment for this class was just to build something using a microcontroller. I decided to merge my two projects, the kinematic motion system and the microcontroller assignment. 

<br>
<br>
At first I wanted to laser cut most of the parts, but since I had little to no time to access the laser cutter until the assignment was due,
I decided to 3D print the majority of the parts. 
Here is a timelapse of some of the feet getting printed!:
