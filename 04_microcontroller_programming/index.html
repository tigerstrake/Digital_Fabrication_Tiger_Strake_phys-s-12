#### Week 2: Microcontroller programming 
<font size="4">
In this lesson we learned how to use Arduinos. Arduinos are small microcontrollers, meaning that they can manage input and output devices. This way you can for example program the Arduino
to move an actuator when a button is pressed. This is a very simplified example, they can manage much more complicated in- and output. 
<br>
The assignment for this class was just to build something using a microcontroller. I decided to merge my two projects, the kinematic motion system and the microcontroller assignment.

Hardware Components
</b>

The following are the key hardware components used in the system:

- Arduino Uno R3: This is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It was used as the brain of the system to control and communicate with all other components.
- L9110H Bridge DC Motor Driver: This was used to control the 6V electric geared motor. The L9110H chip allows for direct control of motor direction and speed via inputs from the Arduino.
- 6V Electric Geared Motor: The DC motor used in this system, which is operated by the L9110H Bridge DC motor driver under the control of the Arduino Uno R3.
- LED Indicator: Consists of a red and a blue LED. The red LED blinks when the system stops, and the blue LED lights up when the system is moving. These LEDs give a visual indication of the system's operational status.
- Power Supply: The system is powered by 6 AA batteries.
- Breadboard: This was used for making connections between components easily, safely, and effectively.
<br>
<br>
I programmed the microcontroller to alter the direction the motor is spinning every few seconds. It turns the motor in one direction for five seconds, then stops for two and then 
continues to spin the motor in the other direction. I also installed little LED indicators that light up when the motor is spinning or stopping. The red LED blinks while the 
motor is stopping while the blue LED is on while the motor spins.

This is the code I used for the Arduino:
</b>




<pre><code style="color: black;">
  const int A1A = 3;  // define pin 3 for speed
  const int A1B = 4;  // define pin 4 for direction
  const int ledPin2 = 12; // LED during movement
  const int ledPin3 = 13; // LED during pause
  
  void setup() {
    pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     // specify these pins as outputs
    pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // start with the motors off 
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(ledPin3, OUTPUT);
  }
  
  void loop() {
    // start the motor 
    digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);   
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, LOW);
    delay(5000);              
  

    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW);
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, HIGH);
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, LOW);
    delay(250);
    }
  
    // start the motor in opposite direction
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);  
    digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, LOW);
    delay(5000);    
  
    // stop the motor
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);  
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW);
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, HIGH);
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, LOW);
    delay(250);
    }
  
  
  }
