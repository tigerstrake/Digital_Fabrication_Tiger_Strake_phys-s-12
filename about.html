### About Me
Hey there! 
My name is Tiger Strake and I am a 16-year-old "space-lunatic" from Germany. 
I have a passion for science, engineering and space and am always seeking for knowledge and adventure. 
This has led me to some interesting internships at ESA (European Space Agency), 
EUMETSAT (European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) 
and DLR (German Center for Air- and Spaceflight). 
I do also go to my local university parallel to school and study physics, instrumental analytics, 
electrical engineering, technical foundations (of material design, photonics, and bionics) and computer science. 
My hobbies include laser cutting and 3d printing at home and everything sports related.
