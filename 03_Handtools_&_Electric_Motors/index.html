#### Week 2: Electric motors, hand tools and soldering
<font size="4">
In this session we talked about three mayor topics: electric motors, hand tools and soldering. So for this weeks assignment we have to apply a bit 
of all the knowledge we gained. The task is to build a kinematic sculpture and include circutry. 
<br>
I decided to build a structure that moves small table tennis balls in mechanically programmable semi circles from side to side. 
My idea was to incorporate a gear reduction system that increases the torque output of the small electric motor and turns an octaganol
camshaft. On the camshaft are small ellipses that move the semi circles up and down. Since there are multiple of these semi circles they can move
in mesmerizing ways e.g. in a sine curve. 
<br>
<br>
At first I wanted to laser cut most of the parts, but since I had little to no time to access the laser cutter until the assignment was due,
I decided to 3D print the majority of the parts. 
Here is a timelapse of some of the feet getting printed!:
