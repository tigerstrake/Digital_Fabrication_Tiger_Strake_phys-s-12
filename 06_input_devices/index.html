Input devices

Today's assignment was to use input devices (aka sensors) to measure something. We built our own sensor and also got to using 
an off-the-shelf gyroscope.
<br>
For the DIY-sensor I decided to build something useful for our final project, a sensor that can 
determine when the rocket takes off. To do so I 3d modeled a tweezer that relies on a compliant mechanism
to stay open. When pressure is applied the two copper ends touch and the circut is closed. 
The 3d model looks like this:

you can download the .stl file

and the .step file 
<a href="compliant sensor touch v1.step" download>here.</a>
<br>
<br>
For the second part of the assignment I decided to use a sensor that would be useful for the final project. To control our rocket
we need to know where it is located and which direction it is pointing. For this we will use a 6-axis Gyroscope. It can measure acceleration
in all 3 spacial axis aswell as yaw, pitch and roll. 
This is how the 3d printed model looks like:
<br>
<br>
Another honorable mention is that I used the 3d printer to upgrade my kinetic sculpture. This iteration now uses heringbone gears. The teeth of 
heringbone gears are angled inwards, giving them more surface area and helping them stay aligned. 
<br>
To create them, I used the Fusion 360 Spur Gear add-in and used the sweep tool to extrude the sketch around the z-axis. Then I rotated the teeth 25Â° and 
repeated the process for the upper half.

3d scanning assignment 
</b>
<br>
<br>
At first, I wanted to scan a NEMA 23 stepper motor. But this did not turn out as well as I hoped it to, so I tried multiple times. Since the results did
not get much better, I settled on useing a photogeometry app called Polycam. I used Polycam to scan multiple Items:
