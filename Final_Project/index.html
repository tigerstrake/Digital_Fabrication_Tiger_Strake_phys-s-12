FINAL PROJECT

  Choice and objective
  <br>
</b>
  The choice of the final project was easy for me. As I am enthusiastic about space and 3d-printing, I chose to design, construct and 3d-print a rocket. In merging my two passions in one project, I knew the outcome would be a success!
  The major objective of my project was:
  To build a parametric modular rocket that features thrust vector control.
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>
  Research process
  <br>
</b>
  I had already build smaller rockets at home and for a school project. I watched YouTube videos on how to build model rockets and researched about real rockets. There is lots of good information on the NASA and the SpaceX website. This showed me the key aspects of a successful rocket. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>
  Design process
  <br>
</b>
  During the design process I focused on the modularity and parametricity. Another idea I had was to use a design for the thrust vectoring unit that I have never seen before. The design relies on the flexibility of the plastic to move. Another focus of the design process was the weight of the rocket. I wanted it to be as light as possible, but still durable. So I tried various wall thicknesses and found the best. 
  Controlled, stable flight was another critical point for me. For this I used electrical components such as microcontrollers, gyroscopes and servo motors. 
  <br>
  <br>
  <b>
  Building process
  <br>
</b>
  For the building process I used my Bambulab 3d-printer, as it is reliable and fast. I printed each module and could then twist-fit them. For the microcontroller, gyroscope and battery I designed a special housing assembly at the bottom of the rocket.

  Lesson learned
  <br>
  <br>

</b>
  1 Persistance is of essence
  <br>

  Initially, I wanted to send my rocket to the sky on the basis of well timed chemical reactions. As this was not allowed, because it was too dangerous, I literally had to choose another direction for my rocket. I took the opportunity to explore another technical challenge instead of giving it up completely. I then focused on electrical components for stabilization. In the end, it worked very well. I was able to turn a perceived failure into a successful plan B, an outcome I had not thought about initially.
  
  2 Take risks

  When Hiranya approached me in week 3 and asked if he could join my project, I was skeptical. I did not know him well and did not know if he would contribute in the same way as I was hooked to the project.
  In the end, I can say that his efforts were genuinely helpful and his different approaches and strengths helped the project to thrive. Without his ideas, the rocket would not have been as complex.
  <br>

  3 To build a good rocket takes lots of time
  
  I underestimated the time I spend on the project. I had designed and printed smaller rockets or objects that flew with the 3d-printer at home, but this project was a whole different ballpark for me. I had to print the outer shell different times, as it did not close precisely, the programming of the gyro was demanding as well. 
  <br>
  <br>
<b>Conclusion</b>
  <br>
  To me, my project was a complete success. The next step for me will be to actually let it fly.
