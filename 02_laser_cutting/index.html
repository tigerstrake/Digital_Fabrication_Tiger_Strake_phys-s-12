#### Week 2: Laser cutting and 3D modelling 

Today we learned how to use a laser cutter and a vinyl plotter. We also made a quick workshop on how to use 3d modelling software, in this case Blender and Fusion 360. 
Our task during classes was to design and laser cut a press-fit structure, that uses multiple cardboard pieces and can be assembled in multiple different ways. We had to 
take into consideration, that the so-called kerf of the laser takes away a bit more material than specified in the design. With all that in mind I designed my structure. 
It is composed of triangles with small notches at all three end which interlock with each other. Here is a picture of the CAD drawing of the triangles.

 I assembled a small sphere with them which you can see here:

The second assignment of today was to model two household items in CAD. I decided to model my (very cool) space mouse and a water bottle. (A space mouse is a computer mouse 
that allows you to freely move in 3d space.) I decided to choose two items that require different methods to model. (e.g., The mouse utilizes the “revolve around axis” tool 
whereas the bottles utilizes the “shell”, “thread” and “loft” tool.)

This is how I modelled my space mouse:

-	First, I took two pictures of it with some calipers next to it so that I would be able to calibrate the image to correct size later. (Since it is symmetrical, I only need one 
picture from above and one from a side.)
<br>
-	Then I imported these pictures into Fusion 360 and put them on their corresponding axis.

<br>
-	After that I used the spline tool to create the outline of one half of the mouse and connected it right in the middle.

<br>
-	Next, I revolved the sketch around the center axis to get a perfectly symmetrical shape.

<br>
-	Then the body was split to give every part a different material and cut of the unnecessary bottom.

<br>
-	Next, I modelled the knobs on the side of the mouse and mirrored them.

<img src="Screenshot7.png" width="816" height="480">
<br>
-	After that I split the model some more and gave every single section a different material. (e.g. rubber and plastic for the top part, aluminum for the bottom etc.)

<br>
-	Finally, I rendered the whole model and exported it.

And this is how I modelled the bottle (this description won’t go in much detail, because):

-	Create cylinder 
-	Make the top thinner using a rectangle as a cutting tool
-	Use a fillet for a smooth transition
-	Create the upper and lower ring (revolve around axis)
-	Use a smaller cylinder and shell tool to make the bottle cap
-	Create threads on bottle and bottle cap (thread tool)
-	Assemble all parts
-	Connect bottle and lid via a band using loft tool
-	Cut out grooves on bottle cap using small circles and a circular pattern

Here is a video on the process:
