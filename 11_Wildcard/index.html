PCB milling and waterjet cutting

  Today we didn't get new homework, but I wanted to use this website to reflect on the lesson!
  <br>
  <br>
  During the assignment we talked about PCB manufacturing. It included to mill custom boards with PCB. Furthermore, we had a workshop on the corresponding CAD software for PCB design, called fusion 360 Eagle. It helps to bring the electronic inventions to life. I designed a circuitboard with some wire routing and some capacitors just to learn the basics of the software.

  <br>
  After that we talked about the water jet cutter. To me, it was highly interesting to see this industrial tool being capable of cutting different materials using an extremely high-pressure jet of water. Thinner materials can be sheet-bent (including metal) as well. After that you can use a spot welder to let electricity flow through material, acting like a resistor and heating up, and the heat welds the two parts together.
  <br>

  I helped Joshua with his final project as we cut the brackets for his stepper-motors for the wall with the water cutter. It worked very precisely!
