3D Design and 3D printing

In this lesson we learned how to operate the Prusa 3d printers in the lab. We also learned how to 3d scan objects using the revopoint camera and software. Personally I found
the results of the mobile app "Polycam" much better. This app allows you to use either the integrated LiDAR scanner of your phone (this is especially useful for bigger rooms)
or photogeometry. Photogeomety uses multiple pictures of an object and digitally stiches them toghether to create a mesh body. This works best for smaller objects. 
<br>
The assignment for today was to 3d print something that could not be manufactured using another technique (or at least be very difficult to make using another technique).
The second part of the assignment was to 3d scan something. 
<br>
For the printing assingment I decided to make something useful for my final project, the rocket. I designed a Thrust Vector Control (TVC) mount that relies on the material 
properties of PLA (Poly lactic acid, a 3d printing filament). It utilizes something called a compliant mechanism. The model can move, because the plastic is not completely 
ridgit, but rather has some flexibility. 
<br>
Here is a picture of the digital 3d modelds:

This is how the 3d printed model looks like:

<br>
Another honorable mention is that I used the 3d printer to upgrade my kinetic sculpture. This iteration now uses heringbone gears. The teeth of 
heringbone gears are angled inwards, giving them more surface area and helping them stay aligned. 
<br>
To create them, I used the Fusion 360 Spur Gear add-in and used the sweep tool to extrude the sketch around the z-axis. Then I rotated the teeth 25Â° and 
repeated the process for the upper half.

3d scanning assignment

At first, I wanted to scan a NEMA 23 stepper motor. But this did not turn out as well as I hoped it to, so I tried multiple times. Since the results did
not get much better, I settled on useing a photogeometry app called Polycam. I used Polycam to scan multiple Items:
