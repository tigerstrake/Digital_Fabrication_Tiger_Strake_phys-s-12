3D Design and 3D printing  
</font>
</b>
<font size="4">
In this lesson we learned how to operate the Prusa 3d printers in the lab. We also learned how to 3d scan objects using the revopoint camera and software. Personally I found
the results of the mobile app "Polycam" much better. This app allows you to use either the integrated LiDAR scanner of your phone (this is especially useful for bigger rooms)
or photogeometry. Photogeomety uses multiple pictures of an object and digitally stiches them toghether to create a mesh body. This works best for smaller objects. 
<br>
The assignment for today was to 3d print something that could not be manufactured using another technique (or at least be very difficult to make using another technique).
The second part of the assignment was to 3d scan something. 
<br>
For the printing assingment I decided to make something useful for my final project, the rocket. I designed a Thrust Vector Control (TVC) mount that relies on the material properties of PLA (Poly lactic acid, a 3d printing filament). It utilizes something called a compliant mechanism. The model can move, because the plastic is not completely 
stiff, but rather has some flexibility. 
<br>
Here is a picture of the digital 3d modelds:

This is how the 3d printed model looks like:

3d scanning assignment

The following are the key hardware components used in the system:

- Arduino Uno R3: This is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It was used as the brain of the system to control and communicate with all other components.
- L9110H Bridge DC Motor Driver: This was used to control the 6V electric geared motor. The L9110H chip allows for direct control of motor direction and speed via inputs from the Arduino.
- 6V Electric Geared Motor: The DC motor used in this system, which is operated by the L9110H Bridge DC motor driver under the control of the Arduino Uno R3.
- LED Indicator: Consists of a red and a blue LED. The red LED blinks when the system stops, and the blue LED lights up when the system is moving. These LEDs give a visual indication of the system's operational status.
- Power Supply: The system is powered by 6 AA batteries.
- Breadboard: This was used for making connections between components easily, safely, and effectively.
<br>
<br>
I programmed the microcontroller to alter the direction the motor is spinning every few seconds. It turns the motor in one direction for five seconds, then stops for two and then 
continues to spin the motor in the other direction. I also installed little LED indicators that light up when the motor is spinning or stopping. The red LED blinks while the 
motor is stopping while the blue LED is on while the motor spins. 
<br>

This is the code I used for the Arduino:
</b>


<pre><code>
  const int A1A = 3;  // define pin 3 for speed
  const int A1B = 4;  // define pin 4 for direction
  const int ledPin2 = 12; // LED during movement
  const int ledPin3 = 13; // LED during pause
  
  void setup() {
    pinMode(A1A, OUTPUT);     // specify these pins as outputs
    pinMode(A1B, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   // start with the motors off 
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    pinMode(ledPin2, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(ledPin3, OUTPUT);
  }
  
  void loop() {
    // start the motor 
    digitalWrite(A1A, HIGH);   
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, LOW);
    delay(5000);              
  

    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);   
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW);
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, HIGH);
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, LOW);
    delay(250);
    }
  
    // start the motor in opposite direction
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);  
    digitalWrite(A1B, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, LOW);
    delay(5000);    
  
    // stop the motor
    digitalWrite(A1A, LOW);  
    digitalWrite(A1B, LOW);
    digitalWrite(ledPin2, LOW);
    for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, HIGH);
    delay(250);
    digitalWrite(ledPin3, LOW);
    delay(250);
    }
  
  
  }
